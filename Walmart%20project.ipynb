    "# MLG - Walmart Classification\n",
    "Brought to you by Zhijing Wu\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Walmart strives for making better understanding and services to their customers consistently from both artistic and scientific approach. One of their methods to make such effort is to segment the store into different sections according to possible trip types, in order to improve shopping experiences for its customers.\n",
    " \n",
    "Walmart believes that this is the best shopping experience for every customer, because the customers can access their demands regardless of leisurely going through their shopping lists or a short trip for instant needs. The company has started combining the existing customer insights and the purchase history data to decide the trip types for the customers. Because such project is meant to optimize the isle placement in store and not to predict what the customers would buy, there is no real-time data employment needed in the model, which means there is no deployment and our model is for offline analysis only.\n",
    " \n",
    "I intend to upgrade such project, which aims to focus on the classifying customer trips using only a transactional dataset of the items purchased by the customers recently. I will be improving the science behind trip type, and the classification of trip type will help Walmart refine its classic segmentation process. Consequently, the items will be placed in the area in accordance to the trip type with which it is most attached.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "Here is a list of the data features contained in our dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "1) TripType - a categorical id representing the type of shopping trip the customer made. This is the ground truth that you are predicting. TripType_999 is an \"other\" category.\n",
    " \n",
    "2) VisitNumber - an id corresponding to a single trip by a single customer\n",
    " \n",
    "3) Weekday - the weekday of the trip\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Upc - the UPC number of the product purchased\n",
    " \n",
    "5) ScanCount - the number of the given item that was purchased. A negative value indicates a product return.\n",
    " \n",
    "6) DepartmentDescription - a high-level description of the item's department\n",
    " \n",
    "7) FinelineNumber - a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart\n",
    " \n",
    "The trip types have been categorized into 38 distinct types using a proprietary method applied to an extended set of data. I intend to recreate this categorization/clustering with optimization and logistic regression algorithms, and each customer would be given exactly one trip type prediction. I believe these methods could provide new and more robust ways to categorize trips, and then helping to improve customer shopping experiences at Walmart.\n",

    "Our data set, in its original form, contains 7 features and 647,054 observations. The features are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "TripType: Each distinct value represents a unique trip type, i.e., the set of circumstances that underlie the customer's trip to a Walmart store. Trip Types could include anything from \"weekly grocery trip\" to \"buying bread (or dinner) on the way home from work.\" The values in this column are integers, and we don't have a key mapping each integer to a trip rationale, so we will have to work with them without knowing what the numbers actually mean. Although the values are stored as integers, this is a discrete/categorical variable, and it is also our target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "VisitNumber: Each distinct value represents a single trip by a Walmart shopper. This is our identifier variable for the dataset we will actually use to train the logistic regression classifier and predict values of TripType. That is, our final dataset will have a number of rows equal to the number of unique values in this column where the TripType is one we choose to predict. (More on that last part in a bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weekday: The day of the week on which the trip to Walmart was made. There are 7 unique values of this variable because this is Walmart, not Chick-fil-a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upc: This feature contains the UPC barcode number that identifies products sold in stores. The number consists of a manufacturer number and a product code, as well as an extra digit calculated from the other digits used for inventory management purposes and to protect against data entry (human) errors. This variable contains a plethora of information, but will ultimately be dropped, as we explain later.\n",
    "\n",
    "ScanCount: The number of a particular item that a customer purchased. For example, 3 represents that the customer bought 3 of whatever item is represented by the value in the Upc column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Department Description: Walmart breaks its stores up into a number of departments which are mutually exclusive. That is, those products which fall into one department fall into only that department. This variable is a string representing that department.\n",
    "\n",
    "FinelineNumber: This is a numeric value representing a \"product category,\" a Walmart-created system that places products into more narrow groups than in the Department Description feature."

    "Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function. Logistic regression models the probabilities for classification problems with two possible outcomes. It's an extension of the linear regression model for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties of population growth in ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment. It’s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression (a.k.a. logit, MaxEnt) classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to 'ovr', and uses the cross-entropy loss if the 'multi_class' option is set to 'multinomial'. (Currently the 'multinomial' option is supported only by the 'lbfgs', 'sag', 'saga' and 'newton-cg' solvers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This class implements regularized logistic regression using the 'liblinear' library, 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs' solvers. Note that regularization is applied by default. It can handle both dense and sparse input. Use C-ordered arrays or CSR matrices containing 64-bit floats for optimal performance; any other input format will be converted (and copied).\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'newton-cg', 'sag', and 'lbfgs' solvers support only L2 regularization with primal formulation, or no regularization. The 'liblinear' solver supports both L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty. The Elastic-Net regularization is only supported by the 'saga' solver."

    "The linear regression model can work well for regression, but fails for classification. Why is that? In case of two classes, you could label one of the classes with 0 and the other with 1 and use linear regression. Technically it works and most linear model programs will spit out weights for you. But there are a few problems with this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear model does not output probabilities, but it treats the classes as numbers (0 and 1) and fits the best hyperplane (for a single feature, it is a line) that minimizes the distances between the points and the hyperplane. So it simply interpolates between the points, and you cannot interpret it as probabilities.\n",

    "A linear model also extrapolates and gives you values below zero and above one. This is a good sign that there might be a smarter approach to classification.\n",
    "\n",

A good illustration of this issue has been given on [Stackoverflow](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22381/why-not-approach-classification-through-regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models do not extend to classification problems with multiple classes. You would have to start labeling the next class with 2, then 3, and so on. The classes might not have any meaningful order, but the linear model would force a weird structure on the relationship between the features and your class predictions. The higher the value of a feature with a positive weight, the more it contributes to the prediction of a class with a higher number, even if classes that happen to get a similar number are not closer than other classes."
